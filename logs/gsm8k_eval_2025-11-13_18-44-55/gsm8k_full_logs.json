    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",

      "text": "Here's a clear, step-by-step solution to Janet's ducks egg-laying problem:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate total eggs laid per day**\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\n**Step 2: Subtract eggs eaten for breakfast and baked into muffins**\nJanet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes 4 eggs into muffins. So, the total number of eggs consumed is:\n3 (breakfast) + 4 (muffins) = 7 eggs\n\n**Step 3: Determine remaining eggs sold at the farmers' market**\nTo find out how many eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market, subtract the eggs consumed from the total eggs laid per day:\n16 (total eggs laid) - 7 (eggs consumed) = 9 eggs\n\n**Step 4: Calculate daily revenue from selling eggs**\nJanet sells each egg for $2. So, to find out her daily revenue, multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg:\n9 eggs x $2 per egg = $18\n\nTherefore, **Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market**.\n\nFinal answer: $\\boxed{18}$",

    "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
    "gold_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3",
    "prediction": {
      "text": "Here's the improved, step-by-step solution:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the amount of blue fiber required**\nThe problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the amount of white fiber required**\nTo find the amount of white fiber required, we need to calculate half of the blue fiber amount. Since there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, we divide this number by 2:\nwhite_fiber = 2 / 2 = 1 bolt\n\n**Step 3: Add the amounts of blue and white fiber**\nTo find the total number of bolts required, we add the amounts of blue and white fiber:\ntotal_bolts = 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts\n\n**Key constraint:** Only whole numbers of bolts can be used, so no fractions are allowed.\n\n**Edge case to watch out for:** Since the problem requires exact quantities, we have ensured that our calculation is precise and accurate. In this case, the total number of bolts required is a whole number (3).\n\n**Final answer:**\nThe total amount of bolts required is 3.",
