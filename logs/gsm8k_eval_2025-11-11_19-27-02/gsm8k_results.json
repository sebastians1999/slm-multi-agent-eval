    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
    "gold_number": "18",
    "model_answer_text": "Let's break down the problem into steps:\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day**\n\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs consumed or used by Janet per day**\n\nShe eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins with 4 eggs daily. So, she uses a total of 7 eggs (3 + 4) per day.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of eggs sold at the farmers' market**\n\nTotal eggs laid = 16\nEggs used by Janet = 7\nRemaining eggs for sale = Total eggs laid - Eggs used by Janet\n= 16 - 7\n= 9\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total amount earned from selling eggs at the farmers' market per day**\n\nJanet sells each egg for $2. So, she earns:\nTotal earnings = Number of eggs sold \u00d7 Price per egg\n= 9 \u00d7 $2\n= $18\n\nTherefore, Janet makes **$18** every day at the farmers' market.",

    "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
    "gold_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3",
    "gold_number": "3",
    "model_answer_text": "To solve this problem, we need some evidence or context. However, based on the given information, I can still provide a step-by-step solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nA robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the amount of white fiber needed**\nSince it takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber, we need to calculate half of 2 bolts. Half of 2 is 1.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total number of bolts needed**\nWe add the number of bolts of blue fiber (2) and the number of bolts of white fiber (1). Total = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nTherefore, it takes a total of **3 bolts** to make a robe.",
