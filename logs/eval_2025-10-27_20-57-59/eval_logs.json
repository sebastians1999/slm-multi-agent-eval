Go through the search results to find the article that has a figure with three axes and labels on each end of the axes, titled \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\".\n5. Note the six words used as labels: deontological, egalitarian, localized, standardized, utilitarian, and consequential.\n6. Go back to arxiv.org\n7. Find \"Physics and Society\" and go to the page for the \"Physics and Society\" category.\n8. Note that the tag for this category is \"physics.soc-ph\".\n9. Go to the Advanced Search page.\n10.

However, I can provide a general approach to solving this type of question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context**\nThe question is asking about a word used in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016. The article is related to AI regulation, which is discussed in various papers submitted to academic platforms like arXiv.org.\n\n**Step 2: Identify relevant information**\nSince the problem doesn't provide specific details about the article or its content, we need to rely on general knowledge and common words associated with society and physics.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze possible answers**\nUnfortunately, there are no options provided for us to choose from. However, based on common labels used in scientific articles, some possibilities could be:\n\n* \"Heterogeneous\" (a term often used in physics and social sciences)\n* \"Homogeneous\" (another term that might be relevant)\n* \"Complexity\" (a concept studied in various fields, including physics and society)\n\n**Step 4: Make an educated guess**\nWithout more information or options to choose from, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on the context of Physics and Society articles, I would take a wild guess that one of these words might be related to describing a type of society.\n\n**Final Answer**\nI'm afraid this is as far as we can go without more information or specific options to choose from. If you provide more details or clarify what's being asked, I'd be happy to try and assist further!"}}]
