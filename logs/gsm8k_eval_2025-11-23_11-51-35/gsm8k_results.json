    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
    "gold_number": "18",
    "model_answer_text": "1. **Calculate Total Eggs Laid**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. **Subtract Eggs Consumed**: Subtract the 3 eggs eaten for breakfast and the 4 eggs used for baking muffins.\n   \\[\n   16 - 3 - 4 = 9\n   \\]\n3. **Calculate Remaining Eggs**: Subtract the total eggs consumed from the eggs laid.\n   \\[\n   9\n   \\]\n4. **Determine Revenue**: Multiply the remaining eggs by $2 per egg.\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 2 = 18\n   \\]\n5. **Edge Case**: Ensure to handle cases where the number of eggs laid is less than the total consumed. In this case, the number of eggs consumed (7) is less than the number of eggs laid (16), so there are no issues with negative eggs.\n\n#### 18",

    "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
    "gold_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3",
    "gold_number": "3",
    "model_answer_text": "1. **Calculate the amount of white fiber needed:**\n   - The problem states that the robe takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber.\n   - Given that 2 bolts of blue fiber are needed, the amount of white fiber required is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Add the blue and white fiber together:**\n   - To find the total bolts of fiber needed, we add the bolts of blue fiber to the bolts of white fiber:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ bolts of blue fiber} + 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber} = 3 \\text{ bolts of fiber}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Verify the total amount of fiber:**\n   - The total amount of fiber required is a whole number, which is 3 bolts.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The robe requires 3 bolts of fiber in total.\n\n#### 3",
