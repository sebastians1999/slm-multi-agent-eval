We need to find out which word is used to describe a type of society in the older paper.\n\n**Step 2: Identify relevant information**\nThe only relevant information provided is that the two papers were submitted to arXiv.org, but there's no direct connection between them. However, we can infer that both papers are academic research papers and might share some common terminology or concepts.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the possible connections**\nSince the problem doesn't provide any explicit links between the two papers, we need to rely on general knowledge about academic research and arXiv.org. We know that researchers often use similar terminology across different fields, especially when discussing societal implications of their work.\n\n**Step 4: Make an educated guess**\nGiven the lack of direct evidence, I'll make an educated guess based on common terminology used in Physics and Society articles. Typically, such articles discuss the social implications of scientific discoveries or technological advancements. A type of society might be described using words like \"hierarchical,\" \"egalitarian,\" or \"capitalist.\"\n\n**Step 5: Choose a word**\nWithout more information, it's impossible to determine which specific word is used in the 2016 article. However, I'll choose one of the most plausible options based on general knowledge.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nI'm going to take a chance and say that the word \"capitalist\" might be used to describe a type of society in the Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016. Please note that this is an educated guess and not a definitive answer.\n\nKeep in mind that without more information or context, it's challenging to provide a more accurate solution. If you have any additional details or clarification, I'd be happy to re-evaluate the problem!"}}]
