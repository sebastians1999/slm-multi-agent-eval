Here's my reasoning:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context**\nThe paper about AI regulation was submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022, which is after the article submitted on August 11, 2016.\n\n**Step 2: Identify relevant information**\nWe need to find out which word from the figure with three axes (from the 2022 paper) is used to describe a type of society. The only relevant information about the 2016 article is its submission date and that it's related to Physics and Society.\n\n**Step 3: Eliminate irrelevant information**\nThe studies mentioned in the summary context are not directly related to the problem, as they focus on AI regulation, communication, and benchmarking systems. We can ignore this information for now.\n\n**Step 4: Look for connections between the articles**\nSince we don't have any direct information about the content of the 2016 article, we need to rely on indirect clues. However, there is no clear connection between the Physics and Society article (2016) and the AI regulation paper (2022).\n\n**Conclusion**\nUnfortunately, based on the provided information, I cannot determine which word from the figure with three axes is used to describe a type of society in the 2016 Physics and Society article.\n\nHowever, if we assume that there might be some indirect connection or similarity between the two articles, one possible approach would be to look for keywords related to \"society\" in the AI regulation paper (2022) and see if any of them match with the labels on the axes. But without more information about the content of both papers, this is purely speculative.\n\n**Final answer**\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find a clear solution based on the provided evidence."}}]
