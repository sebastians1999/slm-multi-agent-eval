    "reasoning_trace": "The search results indicate that a relevant article titled *\"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\"* was submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, under the subject of Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph). The title explicitly mentions \"egalitarian\" and \"hierarchical\" societies, which are types of societies described in the article.\n\nThe word \"egalitarian\" is directly used to describe a type of society in this article.\n\nNow, we need to determine if \"egalitarian\" is one of the label words used in the figure of the 2022 AI regulation paper (with three axes, each having a label word at both ends). Since the specific details of the 2022 paper's figure are not provided, and we are only asked to identify which of the label words from the 2022 paper matches the type of society described in the 2016 article, the only word from the 2016 article that describes a type of society is \"egalitarian.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"egalitarian.\"\n\nFINAL ANSWER: egalitarian"
