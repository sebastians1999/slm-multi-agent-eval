    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
    "gold_number": "18",
    "model_answer_text": "1. **Calculate Total Eggs Laid Daily**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. **Determine Eggs Consumed**: Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins. So, the total eggs consumed is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.\n3. **Calculate Remaining Eggs for Sale**: Subtract the eggs consumed from the total eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n4. **Calculate Revenue from Eggs Sold**: Multiply the remaining eggs by the selling price of $2 per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.\n5. **Edge Case**: The number of eggs consumed (7) does not exceed the total number of eggs laid (16).\n\n#### 18",

    "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
    "gold_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3",
    "gold_number": "3",
    "model_answer_text": "**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of white fiber needed:**\n   - The robe takes half the amount of white fiber as blue fiber.\n   - Given that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 \\text{ bolts of blue fiber}}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum the total bolts needed:**\n   - Add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ bolts of blue fiber} + 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber} = 3 \\text{ bolts in total}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Consider edge cases:**\n   - Ensure that the problem specifies the units for bolts (e.g., bolts of fiber) to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Final answer structure:**\n   - The final answer should be presented as:\n     \"The robe takes a total of 3 bolts of fiber.\"\n\n#### 3",

    "question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",
    "gold_answer": "The cost of the house and repairs came out to 80,000+50,000=$<<80000+50000=130000>>130,000\nHe increased the value of the house by 80,000*1.5=<<80000*1.5=120000>>120,000\nSo the new value of the house is 120,000+80,000=$<<120000+80000=200000>>200,000\nSo he made a profit of 200,000-130,000=$<<200000-130000=70000>>70,000\n#### 70000",
    "gold_number": "70000",
    "model_answer_text": "To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the increased value of the house**:\n   - The initial value of the house was $80,000.\n   - The increase in value is 150% of the initial value.\n   - Increase = 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000.\n\n2. **Determine the new value of the house**:\n   - New value = Initial value + Increase in value\n   - New value = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\n3. **Calculate the total cost of the project**:\n   - Cost of buying the house = $80,000\n   - Cost of repairs = $50,000\n   - Total cost = $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n\n4. **Calculate the profit**:\n   - Profit = New value of the house - Total cost\n   - Profit = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.\n\n#### 70000",
