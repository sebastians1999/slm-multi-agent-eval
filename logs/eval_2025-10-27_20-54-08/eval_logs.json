Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?", "Level": "2", "Annotator Metadata": {"Steps": "1. Go to arxiv.org and navigate to the Advanced Search page.\n2. Enter \"AI regulation\" in the search box and select \"All fields\" from the dropdown.\n3. Enter 2022-06-01 and 2022-07-01 into the date inputs, select \"Submission date (original)\", and submit the search.\n4. Go through the search results to find the article that has a figure with three axes and labels on each end of the axes, titled \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\".\n5. Note the six words used as labels: deontological, egalitarian, localized, standardized, utilitarian, and consequential.\n6. Go back to arxiv.org\n7. Find \"Physics and Society\" and go to the page for the \"Physics and Society\" category.\n8. Note that the tag for this category is \"physics.soc-ph\".\n9. Go to the Advanced Search page.\n10.

However, none of these papers are directly mentioned as being submitted to arXiv.org or containing a figure with labeled axes.\n\n**Step 2: Consider additional context**\nSince there is no direct connection between the 2025 papers and the problem at hand (a paper about AI regulation submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022), I will look for other relevant information. The problem mentions that one of the papers, published on August 11, 2016, was submitted to arXiv.org and is related to Physics and Society.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the given context**\nThe paper from 2016 is mentioned as being related to Physics and Society. However, there is no direct connection between this paper and the figure with labeled axes in the AI regulation paper submitted in June 2022.\n\n**Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the available information**\nSince there is no explicit mention of the words used to describe a type of society in the Physics and Society article from 2016, I will conclude that the problem does not provide sufficient information to determine which word is used to describe a type of society.\n\n**Final Answer:** Insufficient information is provided to answer this question accurately."}}]
