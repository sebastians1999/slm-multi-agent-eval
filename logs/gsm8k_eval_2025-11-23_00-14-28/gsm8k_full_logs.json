    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
    "prediction": {
      "text": " Solution:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of eggs Janet has each day by multiplying the number of eggs laid by her ducks (16) with the number of days in a day (1). So, Janet has 16 eggs per day.\n\n2. Subtract the eggs Janet consumes for breakfast (3) and those used for baking muffins (4) from the total number of eggs. So, Janet has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left for selling.\n\n3. Multiply the remaining eggs by the price per egg at the farmers' market ($2) to find the daily revenue from selling eggs. So, Janet makes 9 * $2 = $18 per day at the farmers' market.\n\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 per day at the farmers' market.\n\n#### 18",

    "question": "A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?",
    "gold_answer": "It takes 2/2=<<2/2=1>>1 bolt of white fiber\nSo the total amount of fabric is 2+1=<<2+1=3>>3 bolts of fabric\n#### 3",
    "prediction": {
      "text": " To find out how many bolts of fiber are required to make a robe, let's follow the high-level plan:\n\n1. Identify the quantity of blue fiber required for a robe:\n   - Since each robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber, if we want to make N robes, the total blue fiber required would be 2 * N bolts.\n\n2. Identify the quantity of white fiber required for a robe:\n   - For each robe, the white fiber requirement is half of the blue fiber requirement. So, the total white fiber required would be (1/2) * 2 * N = N bolts.\n\n3. Calculate the total quantity of blue fiber required:\n   - The total blue fiber requirement for N robes is 2 * N bolts.\n\n4. Calculate the total quantity of white fiber required:\n   - The total white fiber requirement for N robes is N bolts.\n\n5. Sum up the total quantity of blue and white fiber to get the total number of bolts required:\n   - The total number of bolts required for N robes is the sum of blue and white fiber bolts, which is (2 * N) + N = 3 * N bolts.\n\n6. Report the final answer:\n   - The robe requires 3 * N bolts in total, where N is the number of robes to be made.\n\n#### 3*N\nnumber must always be provided as integer, never float.

    "question": "Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?",

    "prediction": {
      "text": " To calculate the profit Josh made from flipping the house, follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the increased value of the house:\n   - Multiply the initial house value ($80,000) by 150% (which is equivalent to 1.5): $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000\n\n2. Add the repair costs to the initial house value:\n   - Add the $50,000 repair costs to the calculated new house value from step 1: $120,000 + $50,000 = $170,000\n\n3. Subtract the initial house cost from the total value:\n   - Subtract the initial house cost ($80,000) from the total value obtained in step 2: $170,000 - $80,000 = $90,000\n\n4. Check for any potential errors or edge cases:\n   - Ensure that the percent increase (150%) is correctly interpreted as a decimal (1.5).\n   - Verify that the repair costs and initial house cost are accurate and positive numbers.\n\n5. Structuring the final answer:\n   - Present the profit as the difference between the total value and the initial house cost: \"Josh made a profit of $90,000.\"\n\n#### 90000",
