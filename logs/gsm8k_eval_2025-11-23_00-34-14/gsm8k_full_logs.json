    "question": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "gold_answer": "Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18",
    "prediction": {
      "text": "1. **Calculate Total Eggs Laid Daily**: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. **Determine Eggs Consumed**: Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast and uses 4 for baking muffins. So, the total eggs consumed is 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.\n3. **Calculate Remaining Eggs for Sale**: Subtract the eggs consumed from the total eggs laid: 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n4. **Calculate Revenue from Eggs Sold**: Multiply the remaining eggs by the selling price of $2 per egg: 9 * 2 = $18.\n5. **Edge Case**: The number of eggs consumed (7) does not exceed the total number of eggs laid (16).\n\n#### 18",

      "text": "**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n1. **Calculate the amount of white fiber needed:**\n   - The robe takes half the amount of white fiber as blue fiber.\n   - Given that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, the amount of white fiber needed is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{2 \\text{ bolts of blue fiber}}{2} = 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Sum the total bolts needed:**\n   - Add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber together:\n     \\[\n     2 \\text{ bolts of blue fiber} + 1 \\text{ bolt of white fiber} = 3 \\text{ bolts in total}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Consider edge cases:**\n   - Ensure that the problem specifies the units for bolts (e.g., bolts of fiber) to avoid confusion.\n\n4. **Final answer structure:**\n   - The final answer should be presented as:\n     \"The robe takes a total of 3 bolts of fiber.\"\n\n#### 3",
