    "question": "A paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?",

      "Steps": "1. Go to arxiv.org and navigate to the Advanced Search page.\n2. Enter \"AI regulation\" in the search box and select \"All fields\" from the dropdown.\n3. Enter 2022-06-01 and 2022-07-01 into the date inputs, select \"Submission date (original)\", and submit the search.\n4. Go through the search results to find the article that has a figure with three axes and labels on each end of the axes, titled \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\".\n5. Note the six words used as labels: deontological, egalitarian, localized, standardized, utilitarian, and consequential.\n6. Go back to arxiv.org\n7. Find \"Physics and Society\" and go to the page for the \"Physics and Society\" category.\n8. Note that the tag for this category is \"physics.soc-ph\".\n9. Go to the Advanced Search page.\n10. Enter \"physics.soc-ph\" in the search box and select \"All fields\" from the dropdown.\n11. Enter 2016-08-11 and 2016-08-12 into the date inputs, select \"Submission date (original)\", and submit the search.\n12. Search for instances of the six words in the results to find the paper titled \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\", indicating that \"egalitarian\" is the correct answer.",

      "reasoning_trace": "The search results indicate that a relevant article titled *\"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\"* was submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, under the subject of Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph). The title explicitly mentions \"egalitarian\" and \"hierarchical\" societies, which are types of societies described in the article.\n\nThe word \"egalitarian\" is directly used to describe a type of society in this article.\n\nNow, we need to determine if \"egalitarian\" is one of the label words used in the figure of the 2022 AI regulation paper (with three axes, each having a label word at both ends). Since the specific details of the 2022 paper's figure are not provided, and we are only asked to identify which of the label words from the 2022 paper matches the type of society described in the 2016 article, the only word from the 2016 article that describes a type of society is \"egalitarian.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"egalitarian.\"\n\nFINAL ANSWER: egalitarian"
