    "question": "A paper about AI regulation that was originally submitted to arXiv.org in June 2022 shows a figure with three axes, where each axis has a label word at both ends. Which of these words is used to describe a type of society in a Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016?",

      "Steps": "1. Go to arxiv.org and navigate to the Advanced Search page.\n2. Enter \"AI regulation\" in the search box and select \"All fields\" from the dropdown.\n3. Enter 2022-06-01 and 2022-07-01 into the date inputs, select \"Submission date (original)\", and submit the search.\n4. Go through the search results to find the article that has a figure with three axes and labels on each end of the axes, titled \"Fairness in Agreement With European Values: An Interdisciplinary Perspective on AI Regulation\".\n5. Note the six words used as labels: deontological, egalitarian, localized, standardized, utilitarian, and consequential.\n6. Go back to arxiv.org\n7. Find \"Physics and Society\" and go to the page for the \"Physics and Society\" category.\n8. Note that the tag for this category is \"physics.soc-ph\".\n9. Go to the Advanced Search page.\n10. Enter \"physics.soc-ph\" in the search box and select \"All fields\" from the dropdown.\n11. Enter 2016-08-11 and 2016-08-12 into the date inputs, select \"Submission date (original)\", and submit the search.\n12. Search for instances of the six words in the results to find the paper titled \"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\", indicating that \"egalitarian\" is the correct answer.",

      "reasoning_trace": "The search results indicate that the article titled *\"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\"* was submitted to arXiv on August 11, 2016, and is relevant to the topic of societal types. The key terms in the title are \"egalitarian\" and \"hierarchical,\" which describe types of societies.\n\nThus, the label words used to describe a type of society in the 2016 article are **egalitarian** and **hierarchical**.\n\nNext, we need to determine which of these words (or any other) appears as a label in the 2022 AI regulation paper's figure. Since the specific details of the 2022 paper's figure are not provided, we must infer based on the context. However, the question asks which of these words is used to describe a type of society in the 2016 article, and from the title, the two words clearly describe societal types.\n\nTherefore, the answer is either **egalitarian** or **hierarchical**.\n\nGiven that the question asks for a word used to describe a type of society in the 2016 article, and both are valid, the most directly descriptive and central terms in the title are **egalitarian** and **hierarchical**.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: egalitarian, hierarchical"
