    "reasoning_trace": "The search results indicate that the article titled *\"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\"* was submitted to arXiv on August 11, 2016, and is relevant to the topic of societal types. The key terms in the title are \"egalitarian\" and \"hierarchical,\" which describe types of societies.\n\nThus, the label words used to describe a type of society in the 2016 article are **egalitarian** and **hierarchical**.\n\nNext, we need to determine which of these words (or any other) appears as a label in the 2022 AI regulation paper's figure. Since the specific details of the 2022 paper's figure are not provided, we must infer based on the context. However, the question asks which of these words is used to describe a type of society in the 2016 article, and from the title, the two words clearly describe societal types.\n\nTherefore, the answer is either **egalitarian** or **hierarchical**.\n\nGiven that the question asks for a word used to describe a type of society in the 2016 article, and both are valid, the most directly descriptive and central terms in the title are **egalitarian** and **hierarchical**.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: egalitarian, hierarchical"
