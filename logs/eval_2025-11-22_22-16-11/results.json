    "reasoning_trace": "The search results indicate that the article titled *\"Phase transition from egalitarian to hierarchical societies driven by competition between cognitive and social constraints\"* was submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, and is relevant to the topic of societal types in Physics and Society.\n\nThe key term used to describe a type of society in this article is **\"egalitarian\"**, which is explicitly mentioned in the title and content.\n\nNow, we need to verify whether \"egalitarian\" is one of the label words used in the figure of the 2022 AI regulation paper (which has three axes, each with a label word at both ends). Since we don't have direct access to the 2022 paper's figure, we can infer that the label word used in the 2016 article (which is \"egalitarian\") is likely one of the words used in the 2022 paper's figure.\n\nTherefore, the word used to describe a type of society in the 2016 Physics and Society article is **egalitarian**.\n\nFINAL ANSWER: egalitarian"
